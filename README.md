## What it does

**linkedscreen** is a service that allows you, with only a few lines of code, to connect a smartphone to a big display ( such as outdoor LED screens), and have the user interact with the content in big display in a "crowded" multi-plyer setup. 

* It is HTML5 based and works with most of the smart phones available on market today.
